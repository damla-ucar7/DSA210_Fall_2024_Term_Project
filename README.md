# Analyzing My Spending Patterns at Coffee Shops at Sabancı University Using Akbank Transaction Data
## Abstract:
  This projects explores the relationship between coffee shop spendings of mine through Akbank transactions and academic deadlines and exam dates over a timeline between 2nd of March 2024 and 31th of December 2024 excluding the summer time. Focusing on coffee shops in my university campus, the purpose is to find patterns of my habits of coffee shop spendings and be in control of my behaviour to optimize my budget in periods of increased academic activity. In this project data will be extracted and visualized using charts. I believe that this project will show me important information about my behaviour and help me to spend my money at coffee shops in a more conscious way. 
  
## Introduction:
  This project mainly focuses on coffee shop spendings of mine because I'm a student and I mostly spend my money to buy a cup of coffee or something to eat between my lectures other than a meal. While I mostly focus on lectures, friends and hobbies of mine -especially on busy weeks- I may not notice how much I've spent throughout the day on coffee or snacks. Therefore, I believe that this project can provide a visual summary of my spending behaviour at coffee shops and help me to optimize my budget. 
  In this project I aim to collect my transaction data of Starbucks, Coffy, Espressolab, Simit Sarayı and Fasshane in my university campus, visualize the patterns and analyze the patterns over time, also try to find a correlation with my important task deadlines, midterms and finals.

## Research Question:
  Does my coffee shop spendings change with respect to specific deadlines, midterms and finals, and which coffee shop I prefer the most during these time periods?

## Hypothesis:
  My visits to the coffee shops increase during exam weeks and deadlines. Also, I prefer Coffy mostly among all the coffee shops in my campus since it is closer to the Information Center. 

## Methodology, Scope and Intended Steps:
  I chose my data source as my Akbank transaction history as pdf files and my academic calendar -including midterms, finals and deadlines of projects, important homeworks and take home tasks- as an excel file. I will extract the related data -Starbucks, Coffy, Espressolab, Simit Sarayı and Fasshane- from the files. I will focus on the time period from 02.03.2024 to 31.12.2024 excluding the summer time that I wasn't in university. Also, as stated above this project will only focus on five coffee shops which are located in our campus. 
  After extracting the related raw data and putting it into a proper form, I will match the dates with the transaction history. I will visualize the data using the methods I learned in the lecture and use a proper chart system to combine all the data. After visualization, I will calculate averages, frequency and correlations. Based on my findings on data I will evaluate my hypothesis and write my conclusion. 
  
  **My intended timeline for the steps I wrote:**
  - **Step1** - Gather all the raw data from Akbank. Form an excel sheet including midterms, finals and deadlines. - Week1
  - **Step2** - Extract the related data from Akbank. Put all the data in a form and match the dates, so that I can work on it. -Week2
  - **Step3** - Visualize the data using tools that are learned in class. -Week3
  - **Step4** - Calculate related statistics and test hypothesis. -Week4
  - **Step5** - Finalize the report. -Week4

## Conclusion:
  The background, purpose and outline of this project is given above. Also, the expected outcome is to find a correlation between my spendings and academic activity and regulate my habits accordingly. For now, I will start to work on the project and update this report based on my progress and findings.
